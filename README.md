# Pi-Hole API to LaMetric
This is some scripts that takes data from your Pi-Hole FTL engine and pushes it to your LaMetric.
The script is setup to run on your Pi-Hole in the /home/pi directory.
You will need to build your own LaMetric app at https://developer.lametric.com & you will have to make it a indicator app
